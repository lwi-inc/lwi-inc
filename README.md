# Louis Delloye's photography portfolio
Hi, I'm Louis Delloye, a Paris-based photographer with a PhD in optics that I put to good use. While I have a soft spot for capturing the city's diverse architecture, I also venture into street photography, portraits, and landscapes. My style? Think bold and pastel colors, strong and soft contrasts, and often a geometric or abstract twist that shifts your perspective on everyday sights.
I'm a fan of both analog and digital photography. The tactile joy of developing film and the endless creative freedom of digital editing keep me hooked to this art form.
Thanks for stopping by to get to know me a bit. If my style resonates with you or you're curious to see more, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something eye-catching and memorable!
